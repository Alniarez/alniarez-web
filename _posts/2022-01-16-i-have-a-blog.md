Yeah, I do. But I don't really have anything to post.
I do not think that writting a blog just for myself is better than writting notes for myself on my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

```¯\_(ツ)_/¯```

I should force myself to write something here from time to time. It is a good excuse to keep up paying for a domain.

# What I am planning (and not actually doing so far)?

I planned to convert this website from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to a fully custom [emberjs](https://emberjs.com/) one, but that requires work that I have been to lazy to do.

I really want to get back to making videogames. Small things just as a hobby. But I am terrible with art. Plus I am shooting myself on the foot by forcing myself to learn something new and more complicated than Unity.

I have been teaching multiple people how to program for web development. Making tutorial posts/learning portal on this website could be cool. That way I don't need to teach the same things several times.

3D modeling is cool and I know almost nothing about that, I should learn it. There is an updated [donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD) going on. (Thanks Andrew)

More stuff about my guinea pigs! [They have a youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMw5QduCsoVXLLZXSr001yQ). I need to post more stuff there.
