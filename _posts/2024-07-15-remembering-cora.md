Cora was my senior female guinea pig.
I adopted her alongside [Lars](https://alniarez.de/blog/2023/04/18/lars-memorial/).


She was probably 10 years old. She was suffering from normal ailments, expected with her advanced age. 
She had a enlarged heart that was taking space from her lungs. Despite this, the was healthy, active and hungry as if she was a youngster.

Cora was a great adventurous piggy.
The smallest of them all, yet the most bossy and pushy of the group.
A punk and an anarchist, no rules applied to her.
If a hay rack was knocked down, a new door on a cardboard hideout created, or a secret pee/poop was found under the sofa; No doubt she would be the culprit 100% of the time, and she would take pride on her actions!

Despite her attitude, on Saturday night she started to develop a bloat, unrelated to any other problem she had before. 
She did not improve on Sunday and on sunday she had an emergency vet visit.
She was not eating well and was inflated heavily. The vet gave her painkillers and medicine after getting X-rays of her. 
Her abdomen was opaque, something had basically taken all the space on her body.
The prognosis was not good.

When we got home we spent time together. I cuddled with her, she lied on my lap and next to me on her bed. She even ate a small amount of cucumber and enjoyed getting pets.
She asked me to go back into her enclosure in the classic way she always did when lap time was over, straight up looking at the cage and trying to jump of me.

When I put her back in the enclosure she walked into the hay feeder. She lied in there, with half of her body buried into the hay. No more than 10 minutes later she died on that very position.

It was all very sudden. I was not ready for this, not even a little. 

Minna is my last guinea pig, and sadly she is dying as well. She has a cancer and nothing can be done. I am just watching her over until her health deteriorates and I cannot justifies keeping her with me, then she will have to be taken to the vet to be put to sleep.

Cora was a great help with Minna.
She kept Minna active and in good company.
Now Minna and I are alone.

She got buried next to Lars on the weekend.
After one year, they are united, sleeping together again.
