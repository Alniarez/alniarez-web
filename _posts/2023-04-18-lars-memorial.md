Lars was my beloved elder guina pig, and he passed in the early morning of the 17th of april 2023.

He recently suffered from hair loss but he had recovered and his hair was growing back healthy and beautifully. But he had also lost almost 300 grams of weight since Christmas day. It does not sound like a lot but for an animal that was 1300g at his largest, being 1030g after a few month is a lot.

Yesterday I expressed my concerns about his age with some friends.
"I'm worried he is just too old" I said, as I shared his image, him showing no signs of giving up, hungry and active.

This picture above would be the last time anyone else but me saw him alive.

Before going to bed I kissed my guinea pigs good night, as I always do.

Lars was hidden in one of the pockets, I raised the fleece and gave him a kiss on his nose. He jumped out into one of the house hideouts and looked at me. "Good night Lars, I love you" I said while booping his nose.

When I woke up next morning I went to greet them good morning. I instantly saw him, collapsed on the floor.
Rear legs stretched out, collapsed sideways on top of his front left leg.

He was in front of his favourite hideout, a cloth strawberry. Maybe he slept in it, woke up, and on his last moment, he standed up, and went out of the hideout just to fall down in front of it.
I just can only hope his last moments were painless.

I put him on a bed and covered with a clean cloth. He was already cold and getting stiff.
I just sat next to him, crying, and telling him how much I love him.

I messaged my close friends and started planning the rest of the day. It was going to be a really hard day.
I went to a hardware store and got clay, on the way back I stopped on a flower shop as they were opening and got some flowers for Lars.


At home I rested the flowers with Lars and used the clay to take prints of his hands.

A friend came by, he was going to take me and Lars to a [local animal shelter](https://www.tierheim-karlsruhe.de/) that has a [pet cemetery](https://www.tierheim-karlsruhe.de/tierfriedhof/).  

Before he arrived I took lars back into the cage. I wanted them all to be together a last time. Cora aproached us, she is the smartest one, I think she knew what was going on. I want to think that she wished farewell to her lifelong cage partnet.

When my friend finally arrived I moved Lars to a cardboard box. We drove to the animal shelter at the other side of town.
We got the burial organized. Lars was left with them. The burial would happen the next day. The location is reserved for me and Lars for the next 6 years.

Talking to her previous owner I digged a bit more into Lars history. 
Lars was adopted from a household where he was not wanted. His cage partner and lover had died already and he was no longer a youngster. 
He moved with his new owner and was introduced to Cora.
They lived together for 6 years until her life got complicated (the owner, not the piggies). 
I showed up then and adopted Lars and Cora in 2020. That makes his death date of 17/04/2023 to be between his 10th and 12th year of life. Lars was indeed a very old animal. 

I worked hard to give him and the others the best life I could give. 
Lars warmed my heart and everyone's he meet. 
He was not the smartest but he was very brave in the presence of food.
He survived  multiple owners, complicated medical issues and reached a very advanced age. 
Being with him was a joy.
My guinea pigs have been the highlight of my life this last few difficult years. 

I am devastated because of his departure, but life goes on and his love will stay with me for ever.
