This is just a small chapter 0 on my trip to learn and use emacs.

For my personal use, I have been mostly using [vscodium](https://vscodium.com). At work IntelliJ is my tool of choice.

After falling victim to a "personal productivity" video spree thanks to YouTube's recommendation algorithm, I came out thinking "I should try out emacs". Yeah, a weird conclusion.

I am not ready to dive deep into using terminal applications as my only text editor, to take a side in the vim vs emacs war, or to try different niche products such as Kakoune.

Despite that, getting a fancy, powerful, nerdy text editor seems like something that I have to at least try. It's a basic pride as a programmer and Linux user, or that is what some sites want me to believe.

To make this a less daunting task, I am easing it by getting Doom Emacs.

First, I have started writing a small cheat sheet for my obsidian vault. After checking just some guidance, I jumped straight into it, and I am here actually writing this post on emacs, running my site generator from within emacs and all that.

So far, I am being way slower than I would be with my usual IDE, but for the first time using this massive tool, it's not that bad.
