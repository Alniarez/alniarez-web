# Projects
## What I am up to?

~~Here I list some of the projects I'm personally working on or that have been important for me in the past.~~

Not much to show right now. Only noteworthy public known thing I have made in recent years is being the programer of an adult oriented game.

### Mentoring

I am teaching programming on my free time. Web dev from scratch to fullstack. My teaching resources are private but I am considering refining them into a proper course that could be offered online.

### Cloud Meadow

Cloud Meadow is a hybrid farming sim dungeon crawler, where the player can choose the solitude of a quiet sky high farm or the rushing adrenaline of a raging battle inside abandoned ruins, both of which benefit one another.

I was the main programmer for the first stretch of development. I worked with some awesome people and they are working hard to make this game.
