    <div class="boxed big-padding">
      <p>I'm a software developer that enjoys programming way too much. I'm always starting side projects and doing all sort creative of stuff.</p>
      <p>I upload some of the code I do to <a href="https://github.com/alniarez">Github</a>, why not take a look to the code I dump there?</p>
    </div>
    <h2>What I am up to?</h2>
    <p>Here I list some of the projects I'm personally working on or that have been improtant for me in the past.</p>
    <h3>Project Noord</h3>
    <p>The idea of this project is to make a simple videogame, a collaborative effort between some cool and creative people I have meet in a Discord server.</p>
    <p>The project is on a <a href="https://github.com/Alniarez/project-noord">repo on Github</a>.</p>
    <h3>Spring Council</h3>
    <p>Yet another game that I am developing with a good friend. A pen and paper roleplaying game this time!</p>
    <p>This is not a software project but it's cool being able to say "I'm writing a book" when listing your hobbies before that moment you have to explain <i>it's a roleplaying game rulebook</i>.</p>
    <h2>Old projects and back burners</h2>
    <h3>Theme arcade</h3>
    <p>A business simulation game about managing arcade rooms.</p>
    <p>This project is on a very early stage and there is no public information released yet. This is a long term side project.</p>
    <h3>Discord bots</h3>
    <p>I took commission developing Discord and Telegram bots for gaming communities, YouTubers, Streamers, and Crypto-currency control groups.</p>
    <p>With a friend of mine (<a href="https://github.com/Eidun">Beo</a>) we managed to have a healthy client base in the cryptocurrency scene and some of our chat bots were used in world wide operations.</p>
    <p>There were headlines in newspapers about our bots!! It's a long story...</p>
    <p>Now the crypto craze is <i>over</i> and I moved to different projects; nonetheless it was fun and I did learn a lot. The code for all my bots will eventually be set to public on Github.</p>
    <p>You can see some reviews of my work on <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/alniarez">my Fiverr profile</a> where I used to offer my services for a short periof of time.</p>
    <h3>Cloud Meadow</h3>
    <p>This is a video game I worked on for more than a year. It's still on development but about to be released!</p>
    <img class="rounded image center" src="/assets/images/CM_Banner_January_2018.png" alt="Cloud Meadow banner">
    <p>Cloud Meadow is a hybrid farming sim dungeon crawler, where the player can choose the solitude of a quiet sky high farm or the rushing adrenaline of a raging battle inside abandoned ruins, both of which benefit one another.</p>
    <p>I was the main programmer for a long time on this game. I worked with some awesome people and they are working hard to make this game.</p>
    <p>Follow the progress and support the project at Patreon.</p>

    <h3>World of Bugs - MMORPG</h3>
    <p>During our second year of college my friend ((<a href="https://github.com/Eidun">Beo</a>) and I tried build our own MMRRPG.</p>
    <p>Top down square tiles based game. It looked like a GBA RPG with higher resolution.</p>
    <p>The plan was to add more zones with a final dungeon/boss that needs to be defeated to unlock the next zone. We had the central city hub and the first zones working.</p>
    <p>The engine and scripts were built in Visual Basic and the system managed to have 5 players online at the same time, quite a feat for some students that knew almost nothing.</p>
    <p>It was so buggy that we called it Wold of Bugs. We eventually lost interest and the project halted, we never finished programming the first boss fight.</p>
    <h3>Combate Galáctico</h3>
    <p>"Combate Galáctico" is the name of my first video game, made back in 2008 (or 2009?).</p>
    <p>It's a 1 or 2 player space combat simulator. The ships move left and right trying to destroy each other with laser attacks while dodging asteroids.</p>
    <p>Actually a horrible flash game made by a teen!! But it is the spark that started the dumpster fire I call "my projects folder".</p>
