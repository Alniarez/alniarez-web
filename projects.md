# Projects

> I'm a software developer that enjoys programming way too much. I'm always starting side projects and doing all sort creative of stuff.
>
> I upload some of the code I do to [Github](https://github.com/alniarez), most is private anyway as it is uncomplete or not useful at all.

## What I am up to?

~~Here I list some of the projects I'm personally working on or that have been improtant for me in the past.~~

Not much to show right now. Only noteworthy public known thing I have made in recent years is being the programer of an adult oriented game.

### Cloud Meadow

The game has been released on [Steam as an early access game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1223750/Cloud_Meadow/).

Cloud Meadow is a hybrid farming sim dungeon crawler, where the player can choose the solitude of a quiet sky high farm or the rushing adrenaline of a raging battle inside abandoned ruins, both of which benefit one another.

I was the main programmer for a long time on this game. I worked with some awesome people and they are working hard to make this game.
