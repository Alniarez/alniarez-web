    <p>I'm a software developer that enjoys programming way too much. I'm always starting side projects and doing all sort creative of stuff.</p>
    <p>I upload some of the code I do to <a href="https://github.com/alniarez">Github</a>, most is private anyway as it is uncomplete or not useful at all.</p>

  <h2>What I am up to?</h2>
  <p style="text-decoration: line-through">Here I list some of the projects I'm personally working on or that have been improtant for me in the past.</p>
  <p>Not much to show right now. Only noteworthy public known thing I have made in recent year is being a programer for an adult oriented game.</p>
  <h3>Cloud Meadow</h3>
  <p>This is a video game I worked on for more than a year. It's still on development but about to be released!</p>
  <img class="rounded image center" src="/assets/images/CM_Banner_January_2018.png" alt="Cloud Meadow banner">
  <p>Cloud Meadow is a hybrid farming sim dungeon crawler, where the player can choose the solitude of a quiet sky high farm or the rushing adrenaline of a raging battle inside abandoned ruins, both of which benefit one another.</p>
  <p>I was the main programmer for a long time on this game. I worked with some awesome people and they are working hard to make this game.</p>
  <p>Follow the progress and support the project at Patreon.</p>
